        While air pollution is the most visible and studied environmental consequence of transportation systems, water pollution and wetlands issues are also of crucial importance. For instance; fuel, particles, and salt-laden runoff from streets and highways result in damage to roadside soil, vegetation and trees, ponds and water supplies ([source](https://courses.washington.edu/gmforum/topics/trans_water/trans_water.htm)). 
        The impact from the road may also contribute to other forms of water pollution, like [water turbidity](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/turbidity-and-water). 


        Or does it?


        Let us try to investigate this matter by providing you with a few plots that (hopefully) helps you understand how the traffic situation is in New York City and it's boroughs.
        
        We are looking at [this dataset about New York traffic](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Traffic-Volume-Counts-2012-2013-/p424-amsu), containing roughly 392.000 observations of traffic volume counts collected by [The New York City Department of Transportation’s (NYC DOT)](https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/about.shtml) for New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) to validate the New York Best Practice Model (NYBPM) ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/ny-traffic-volume-counts-2012-2013)).

        The dataset used for this analysis contains observations in the time interval '2015-02-07' to '2021-05-09' and has the following (interesting) columns:
        - Date
        - Street name
        - Time
        - Traffic volume

        Thus, the core steps in the preprocessing of this data consisted of:
        - Enriching the data with latitude and longitude pr "street name" (e.g. 156 Street)
        - Enriching the data with what borough (that is e.g. Queens, Staten Island etc..) these street belong to

        After the dataset had been preprocessed, we ended up with roughly 27.000 rows.
